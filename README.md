Sleep detection using accelerometer data as part of project in Math and Data Modelling 3 at Univerisy of Bristol, spring of 2017, in collaboration with the SPHERE group.

The project uses data gathered during the sleep phase of participants in the SPHERE project, this project intends to make an analysis of the data in three main areas - sleep detection, night quality assesment and ideal environment model.

The latest version of the project may be viewed in 'analyseSleep.ipnb', which is a version of Python Notebook with the data already run, therefore the results can be viewed directly. To run the script yourself you need access to the 'irc-sphere-sleep' repository. Special access is currently [2017-06-18] needed to access the data, please contact tom.diethe@bristol.ac.uk for further information. You may also need to configure file paths depending on your file hierarchy.
